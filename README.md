## 🎥 Rabbit Hole Syndrome

I've realized that I often get lost down rabbit holes wondering how things _actually_ work under the hood. 🐰 🕳 🩺 💻

So instead of keeping it to myself, I created a YouTube channel where I can post these adventures as I go.

Feel free to join me down the rabbit hole as I dig through different tech to find out how they really work, why they were built that way, and how we can use this to build better products.
